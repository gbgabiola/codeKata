# [Day 2: Loops](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-loops)

#### Objective
In this challenge, we practice looping over the characters of string. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

#### Task
Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function in the editor below. It has one parameter, a string, `s`, consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). The function must do the following:

1. First, print each vowel in `s` on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in `s`.
2. Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in  on a new line in the same order as it appeared in `s`.

#### Input Format
Locked stub code in the editor reads string `s` from stdin and passes it to the function.

#### Output Format
First, print each vowel in `s` on a new line (in the same order as they appeared in `s`). Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in  on a new line (in the same order as they appeared in `s`).

#### Explanation 0
Observe the following:

- Each letter is printed on a new line.
- Then the vowels are printed in the same order as they appeared in `s`.
- Then the consonants are printed in the same order as they appeared in `s`.
