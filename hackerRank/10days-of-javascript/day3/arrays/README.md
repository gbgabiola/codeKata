# [Day 3: Arrays](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/js10-arrays)

#### Objective
In this challenge, we learn about Arrays. Check out the attached tutorial for more details.

#### Task
Complete the getSecondLargest function in the editor below. It has one parameter: an array, `nums`, of `n` numbers. The function must find and return the second largest number in `nums`.

#### Input Format
Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function: 
The first line contains an integer, `n`, denoting the size of the `nums` array. 
The second line contains `n` space-separated numbers describing the elements in `nums`.

#### Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 10`
- `0 <= nums`<sub>i</sub>, where `nums`<sub>i</sub> is the number at index `i`.
- The numbers in `nums` are not distinct.

#### Output Format
Return the value of the second largest number in the `nums` array.

#### Sample Input 0
```
5
2 3 6 6 5
```

#### Sample Output 0
```
5
```

#### Explanation 0
Given the array `nums = [2,3,6,6,5]`, we see that the largest value in the array is `6` and the second largest value is `5`. Thus, we return `5` as our answer.
