# Day 3: Intro to Conditional Statements

## Objective
In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements. Check out the <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-conditional-statements/tutorial">Tutorial</a> tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Given an integer, <em>n</em>, perform the following conditional actions:

  * If <em>n</em> is odd, print Weird
  * If <em>n</em> is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
  * If <em>n</em> is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
  * If <em>n</em> is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
  
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

## Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, <em>n</em>.

## Constraints
  * 1 <= <em>n</em> <= 100

## Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

## Sample Input 0

3

## Sample Output 0

Weird

## Sample Input 1

24

## Sample Output 1

Not Weird

## Explanation

<em>Sample Case 0: n</em> = 3
<em>n</em> is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

<em>Sample Case 1: n</em> = 24
<em>n</em> > 20 and <em>n</em> is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
