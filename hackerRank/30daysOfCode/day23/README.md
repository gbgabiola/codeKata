# [Day 23: BST Level-Order Traversal](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-trees)

#### Objective 
Today, we're going further with Binary Search Trees. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-trees/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

#### Task 
A level-order traversal, also known as a breadth-first search, visits each level of a tree's nodes from left to right, top to bottom. You are given a pointer, `root`, pointing to the root of a binary search tree. Complete the levelOrder function provided in your editor so that it prints the level-order traversal of the binary search tree.

**Hint:** You'll find a queue helpful in completing this challenge.

#### Input Format
The locked stub code in your editor reads the following inputs and assembles them into a BST:  
The first line contains an integer, `T` (the number of test cases).  
The `T` subsequent lines each contain an integer, `data`, denoting the value of an element that must be added to the BST.

#### Output Format
Print the `data` value of each node in the tree's level-order traversal as a single line of `N` space-separated integers.

#### Sample Input
```
6
3
5
4
7
2
1
```

#### Sample Output
```
3 2 5 1 4 7
```

#### Explanation
The input forms the following binary search tree:

We traverse each level of the tree from the root downward, and we process the nodes at each level from left to right. The resulting level-order traversal is `3` &rarr; `2` &rarr; `5` &rarr; `1` &rarr; `4` &rarr; `7`, and we print these data values as a single line of space-separated integers.
