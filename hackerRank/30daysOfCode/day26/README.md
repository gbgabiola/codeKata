# [Day 26: Nested Logic](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-nested-logic)

#### Objective 
Today's challenge puts your understanding of nested conditional statements to the test. You already have the knowledge to complete this challenge, but check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-nested-logic/tutorial) tab for a video on testing!

#### Task 
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: `fine = 0`).
2. If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, `fine = 15 Hackos x (the number of days late)`.
3. If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the `fine = 500 Hackos x (the number of months late)`.
4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of `10000 Hackos`.

#### Input Format
The first line contains `3` space-separated integers denoting the respective `day`, `month`, and `year` on which the book was actually returned.  
The second line contains `3` space-separated integers denoting the respective `day`, `month`, and `year` on which the book was expected to be returned (due date).

#### Constraints
- `1 <= D <= 31`
- `1 <= M <= 12`
- `1 <= Y <= 3000`
- `It is guaranteed that the dates will be valid Gregorian calendar dates.`

#### Output Format
Print a single integer denoting the library fine for the book received as input.

#### Sample Input
```
9 6 2015
6 6 2015
```

#### Sample Output
```
45
```

#### Explanation
Given the following return dates: 
Actual: `D`<sub>a</sub> `= 9, M`<sub>a</sub> `= 6, Y`<sub>a</sub> `= 2015`  
Expected: `D`<sub>e</sub> `= 6, M`<sub>e</sub> `= 6, Y`<sub>e</sub> `= 2015`

Because `Y`<sub>e</sub> `=== Y`<sub>a</sub>, we know it is less than a year late.  
Because `M`<sub>e</sub> `=== M`<sub>a</sub>, we know it's less than a month late.  
Because `D`<sub>e</sub> `< D`<sub>a</sub>, we know that it was returned late (but still within the same month and year).

Per the library's fee structure, we know that our fine will be `15 Hackos x (# days late)`. We then print the result of `15 x (D`<sub>a</sub> `- D`<sub>e</sub>`) = 15 x (9 - 6) = 45` as our output.
